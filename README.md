TODO:
1) Check what's in the log (remove un-necessary logging and deal with weird things being added)
2) Seriously check for bonkers data
3) Handle links with ?s and #s
4) Add network may including tooltips and hierarchies
5) Click on an node to jump to that page (how would that work for clustering?)
6) Clustering : http://goo.gl/nRF4MO (plus vis.js docs if that's not that)
