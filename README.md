TODO:
0) Change code to work with APIs
1) Check what's in the log (remove un-necessary logging and deal with weird things being added)
2) Seriously check for bonkers data
3) Handle links with ?s and #s
4) Multi layers to network
5) Click on an node to jump to that page (how would that work for clustering?)
6) Clustering : http://goo.gl/nRF4MO (plus vis.js docs if that's not that)
7) Lots of testing
8) Different node colour for external urls
9) Provide an API (include use if IN %thing% where appropriate):
9.1) Two times getById (include LIMIT)
9.2) getPageByURL
9.3) getPageByPageTitle 
9.4) getLinkByLinkText
